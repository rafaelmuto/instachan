# ᶘ ᵒᴥᵒᶅ InstaChan

a one file solution for image BBS ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

---

InstaChan is in no way a substitute for more robust bbs and chans-a-like.
But if you need a quick and dirty way to set a BBS for few people it may just be your chan!
The premisses are as follow:

1. It is free! to use and mod, but if you do so pls mention me ;)
2. It's a one file does it all project.... it's not meant to be fast or efficient, it's meant as a joke!
3. I do not take responsibility for any damage this peace of software may cause to you or to your system... you've been warned! o\_\_\_o
4. This is not a serious board and it's meant as a quick and cheap way to setup a chan in your server.
5. This is just a study for a one file image board BBS using PHP and JSON.

Just upload this file to a php able server and watch it burn! ʕ ￫ ᴥ ￩ ʔ

Have fun...

## Getting started...

Just put the instachan.php file in a PHP able server and run it!
It'll run a first time setup and create the needed folder and files.
To reset just delete the .json files and it will be just as new ;)

to delete just delete every thing...
it's no rocket science... o\_\_\_O

docker: `docker run -d -p 8081:80 --name instachan -v "$PWD":/var/www/html php:7.2-apache`

## To Do...

- implement security against code injection ಠ▃ಠ
- a way to create thumb nails
- a quote function, to quote other people msg...
- multi threads... maybe doable with the following ;)
- implement object oriented programming..
- implement deleting instafolder and files...

## DONE!

- ~auto delete board after n number of post~
- ~ERROR: if number of post per page is a multiple of number of posts the pages index gets 1 empty page at the end... and some more...~ DONE!!!
- ~ERROR: some times we get a error when trying to reset the chan: Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by~ DONE?
- ~color themes DONE!~ =D
- ~configuration at the first run~ DONE!
- ~multy page support... I've been thinking in ways to do this...~ DONE!

## History

v1 -- multy page, config on first run, themes

v0 -- Basic text and image function, JSON "database". Post can be posted and deleted.
One file, easy deploy...
